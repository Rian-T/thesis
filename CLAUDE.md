# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PhD thesis repository for Rian Touchent-Saad at Sorbonne Université / INRIA Paris (ALMAnaCH Team).

**Title:** "Public-Data Pretraining for Clinical Information Extraction: Methods under Scarcity and Privacy Constraints"

**Archive:** Nathan Godey's original thesis content is preserved in `_archive/` for reference.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the thesis
latexmk

# Clean auxiliary files
latexmk -c
```

The build uses **LuaLaTeX** with `--shell-escape`. On locale issues, prefix with `LC_ALL=C`.

## Bibliography Hallucination Check

A single hallucinated reference can cause a desk reject. `tools/verify_bib.py`
resolves every **cited** bib entry against real databases (Crossref by DOI,
arXiv by id, then OpenAlex / DBLP / Crossref by title) and flags any whose
metadata does not match a real publication.

```bash
make checkbib          # cited entries only (default), non-blocking report
make checkbib-all      # every entry in thesis.bib
make checkbib-strict   # exit 1 if any MISMATCH/NOT_FOUND (pre-submission gate)
```

- Verdicts: `VERIFIED` / `MISMATCH` (found but a field diverges — likely
  hallucination) / `NOT_FOUND` (possibly invented) / `SKIPPED` (whitelisted).
- It is **non-blocking by design**: it flags for human review, never edits the
  `.bib`. It validates that a reference is *real and accurate*, not that the
  *right* paper is cited in the right place (that stays a human job).
- False positives happen on poorly-indexed venues (French ATALA/TALN/DEFT
  workshops, e.g. `cardon_presentation_2020`). Add genuinely-unverifiable keys
  to `tools/bibcheck_whitelist.txt` — keep that list short and justified.
- Results are cached in `tools/.bibcheck_cache.json`, so re-runs are fast/offline.
- Run `make checkbib` after adding or editing any `\cite`d reference, and
  `make checkbib-strict` before any submission.

## Git Commit Conventions

These OVERRIDE any default Claude Code commit behavior:

- **Sole author is Rian.** Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers (no Claude, no anyone). The git author config (`rian-t <rian.touchent@inria.fr>`) is already correct — do not change it.
- **Messages: minimal, telegraphic, dense.** Lowercase, no filler, no marketing slop. State exactly what changed (and why, if non-obvious) in as few words as possible. One-line subject; add a terse body only when several distinct changes need listing.
- Good: `dedup bib: drop 4 ontobook duplicate entries, ch6 -> canonical keys`
- Bad: `This commit improves the bibliography by carefully removing some duplicate entries that were found...`

## Current Status

Chapter↔label↔source map (labels are set in the part orchestration files, not in `article.tex`):

| Ch | `\label` | Title | Source paper |
|----|----------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | `chap:collecting` | Collecting Biomedical Text | CamemBERT-bio (corpus part) |
| 2 | `chap:quality` | Detecting Content Types | Biomed-Enriched + BiaHS (GAPeron) |
| 3 | `chap:mcbio` | Which Quality Signals Matter? | MC-Bio / biomed-fr-v2 (TALN 2026) |
| 4 | `chap:encoders` | Encoder Models for French Biomedicine | CamemBERT-bio (pretraining/eval) |
| 5 | `chap:objectives` | Beyond Masked Language Modeling | CLM Detour (COLM 2026) |
| 6 | `chap:ontobook` | Knowledge-Enriched Pretraining | OntoBook (LREC 2026) |
| 7 | `chap:limits` | Limits of Direct Fine-Tuning | discussion (no paper) |
| 8 | `chap:architectures` | Architectures for Low-Resource Extraction | frenchmed-gliner / MedEmbed (WIP) |
| 9 | `chap:synthetic` | Synthetic Data for Task Adaptation | OntoBook data + synthetic clinical reports (WIP) |

### Chapters Done (draft)
- **Ch 1 (`chap:collecting`)** — biomed-fr corpus (413M words, ISTEX/CLEAR/E3C). Hook, tables, vocab analysis, cliffhanger to Ch 4.
- **Ch 2 (`chap:quality`)** — Biomed-Enriched (paragraph-level annotation, 2M clinical case paragraphs) + BiaHS as footnoted section. Full method/results/discussion. TODO: real PMC paragraph examples in the motivation figure; annotation prompt in appendix.
- **Ch 3 (`chap:mcbio`)** — biomed-fr-v2 (10B tokens, 6 sources). Content-type + quality-signal ablations (writing-quality/term filters *degrade* perf). Done.
- **Ch 4 (`chap:encoders`)** — CamemBERT-bio pretraining (+2.54 F1, 32× less CO2; DrBERT 20-pt loss = eval artifact). Done.

### Chapters Drafted But With Debt
- **Ch 5 (`chap:objectives`)** — CLM Detour (COLM 2026). Body is integrated, BUT §2.1 "When Decoder Continue-Pretraining Stops Working" is **entirely a placeholder** (notes in comments: BioMistral -0.9, Meditron 332 GPU-h, Dorfner, forgetting, data overlap). 3 figures still TODO: needle-in-haystack, CKA combined, freeze interventions.
- **Ch 6 (`chap:ontobook`)** — OntoBook (LREC 2026). Pasted verbatim, not yet thesis-ified: intro is the paper intro (not a hook); conclusion starts with "We presented…" (forbidden); uses `\section{Conclusion}` instead of `\section*`; tables/figures not yet on `thesis-style.sty`. Bib duplicates already fixed (now uses canonical keys: `lee_biobert_2019`, `gu_domain-specific_2022`, `martin-etal-2020-camembert`, `devlin_bert_2019`).

### To Write
- **Ch 7 (`chap:limits`)** — discussion chapter (no paper). Sets up why direct fine-tuning fails for clinical IE (label scarcity, thousands of classes, public-text-only) to motivate Ch 8-9.
- **Ch 8 (`chap:architectures`)** — frenchmed-gliner / MedEmbed. **Very WIP** (notes dated 2026-01-29 in `publications/frenchmed-gliner/paper/`): GLiNER2 bi-encoder, MedEmbed label encoder (ModernCamemBERT-base, 8192 ctx), ~1.5M training pairs (RDF/synthetic/persona), OntoBench-FR benchmark, MedEmbed-v4 = 32.9% avg (vs Solon 32.5%). No stable results yet.
- **Ch 9 (`chap:synthetic`)** — §OntoBook data (currently duplicates Ch 6's walk-generation prose — should `\Cref` to Ch 6 instead of repeating); §synthetic clinical reports is a placeholder (paper in progress).
- **Front matter** — abstract/résumé, introduction (with research questions), conclusion. Not started.

### Key Decisions Made
- CamemBERT-bio paper split: corpus → Ch 1, pretraining/eval → Ch 4
- BiaHS is a section within Ch 2 (not its own chapter), footnoted as contribution to GAPeron
- Discussion chapters (Ch 5, Ch 7) have no underlying paper — they set up problems
- Preserve original paper text in article chapters; only add thesis framing
- Paper appendices go INTO the chapter body (no manuscript-wide appendix for paper details)
- Related work for chapter-specific topics stays IN the chapter, not promoted to the manuscript-wide RW
- No "We have introduced X" in conclusions — conclude on insight, use cliffhangers
- Bibliography is active (`\bibliography{thesis}` uncommented)
- `publications/` contains live git clones of paper repos (kept up-to-date by re-cloning)

## Document Structure

- **Main file:** `thesis.tex`
- **Document class:** `mimosis.cls` (KOMA-script based)
- **Bibliography:** `thesis.bib` with `acl_natbib` style

## Key Files to Modify

1. **Chapter content:** `sources/part_*/chapter*/article.tex`
2. **Part titles:** In `thesis.tex`, update `\part[...]`
3. **Chapter titles:** In orchestration files (`analysis_lm.tex`, `extensions_lm.tex`, `clinical_tasks.tex`)

## Mandatory Reading Before Writing

**Read these files before drafting any thesis content.** They define voice, structure, formatting, and visual style.

| File | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `guidelines/writing-guide.md` | Voice & tone (academic "we", measured, no hype), sentence structure, tense rules, hedging, precision with numbers, transitions, paragraph length, word choice, thesis structure (intro/RW/research chapters/conclusion anatomy), section-by-section templates, LaTeX formatting conventions (`\Cref{}`, `\paragraph{}`, `\section*{Conclusion}`), hard rules (no spoiling in RW, no redundancy, always back claims with numbers), chapter type rules (article vs discussion), hook patterns, conclusion patterns (no "we introduced X", use cliffhangers) |
| `guidelines/visual-style.md` | Table style (booktabs, siunitx, colored group headers), figure style (bar charts, line plots, pipeline diagrams), color palette reference, do/don't quick reference |
| `guidelines/style-proposals.pdf` | Visual reference PDF with validated styles: tables (A1/A2/A3), bar charts (A/B/D), line plots (A markers/B confidence band), pipelines (A horizontal/B vertical), all on Palette 4 (Lavender & Lime) |
| `thesis-style.sty` | **Centralized LaTeX style** — all colors (`ThesisPrimary`, `ThesisSecondary`, `ThesisTertiary`), pgfplots presets, TikZ pipeline styles, table helpers (`\tablegroup{N}{Title}`). Changing colors here updates the entire manuscript. |
| `plots/thesis_style.py` | **Centralized Python style** — mirrors `thesis-style.sty` colors for matplotlib plots. All plot scripts import from here. |

## Notes

- French front matter, English body text
- Cross-references use `cleveref` (`\Cref{}`)
- `\PassOptionsToPackage{usenames,dvipsnames,table}{xcolor}` before `\documentclass` for `\rowcolor` support
- **All figures/tables must use `thesis-style.sty` presets** — never define ad-hoc colors or styles in chapter files
- **All Python plots must use `plots/thesis_style.py`** — never hardcode colors in plot scripts
- **Preserve original paper text** in article chapters — only add thesis framing (hooks, transitions, `\Cref{}`)
